## Vector Victor ##

The purpose of this program is to work on Test Driven Development as well as
work on list comprehension.

The full program, vector_victor.py, doesn't actually have any user input or
any way to access it other than running the nosetest program against it.
The program vector_victor_test.py is meant to input different numbers, vectors,
and matrices to make sure the list comprehension for each comparable is
written correctly and throws the correct exceptions when expected.
