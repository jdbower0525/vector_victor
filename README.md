## Vector Victor ##

The purpose of this program is to work on Test Driven Development as well as
work on list comprehension.

The full program, vector_victor.py, doesn't actually have any user input or
any way to access it other than running the nosetest program against it.
The program vector_victor_test.py is meant to input different numbers, vectors,
and matrices to make sure the list comprehension for each comparable is
written correctly and throws the correct exceptions when expected.

To run the program, use nosetests with vector_victor_test.py and see that all
of the tests pass on the different computations for vectors and matrices in
the python language.
